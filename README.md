# fliptiles
Graphic square tiles that flip and implemented for digital badges showing badge graphic on one side and information about the badge on the flip side. 

Note: I used the Shortcoder plugin for Wordpress to embed this in a Wordpress page with one line of code: [sc name="Badges Interactive Infographic"]
